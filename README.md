my work about emotions

Hello, people.
This project is important to me as a way to remind me of the most important discovery of my life, 
namely the presence of emotions in men. As a child, not understanding what it is at all, but feeling unwell,
he began to use rather destructive ways to escape from himself. This lasted up to 36 years. Thanks to the works of David Hawkins, I saw the light. 
I don't know what could be more important than this, because emotions form thoughts. And this crazy flow affects life.
